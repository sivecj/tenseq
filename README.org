* tenseq
Teensy 3 (LC) sequencer. Written in Arduino.

Very early development. It currently features a basic sequencer that is able to
record a note sequence up to 32 steps. It plays the sequence back automatically.

Most settings can be set in the lines with ~#define~.

*Summary:*
- Enter MIDI notes via a USB MIDI input channel (/default: MIDI USB channel 2/).
- Output MIDI notes to a USB MIDI output channel (/default: MIDI USB channel 1/).
- Input an empty note either with a button (/default: Pin 2/) or via the MIDI
  note 0.

** Dependencies
